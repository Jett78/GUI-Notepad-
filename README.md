# GUI-Notepad-
This is a notepad GUI created using java swing.It is not as quite responsive as the normal notepad existed in the system but just to get the knowlegde about the components like JMenuBar and JmenuItem.But we can copy cut paste and select the text written in the textbox.Besides that none of the actual button does the job,it is just for the UI.
